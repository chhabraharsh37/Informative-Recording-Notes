1. Don't use words and acronyms which are not very common (As essay reviewer can be from any region may be India, Europe, London).
1. Do some background research about the program and the track you are choosing (essay may change diversely in every track).
2. Be more specific and stop writing incomplete sentences which might leave reviewer with questions.
